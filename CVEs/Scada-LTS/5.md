# Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection via SVG File Upload Bypass

### Summary

<p align="justify">A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG File Upload Bypass vulnerability was identified in the <code>view_edit.shtm</code> endpoint of the Scada-LTS application. This vulnerability allows attackers to upload malicious files into the <code>backgroundImageMP</code> parameter. The injected files are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk.</p>

---

### Details

Vulnerable Endpoint: `view_edit.shtm`

Parameter: `backgroundImageMP`

Trigger Page: `/uploads/[ID].svg`

<p align="justify">The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the <code>backgroundImageMP</code> parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system.</p>

### PoC

#### Step by Step:

<p align="justify">Save the payload in the <code>xss.svg</code> file.</p>

<p align="justify">After, access the <code>views.shtm</code> page, and click on <code>"computer +"</code> to add a new <code>"view"</code>, click on <code>"Escolher arquivo"</code> button to choose the malicious file, then click on <code>"Upload image"</code> button to upload the file, after that, click on <code>"Save"</code> button. Access the file by the trigger page.</p>
