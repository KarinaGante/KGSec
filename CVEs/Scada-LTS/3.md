# Multiples Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `mailing_lists.shtm`

### Summary

<p align="justify">Multiples Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the <code>mailing_lists.shtm</code> endpoint of the Scada-LTS application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the <code>name</code>, <code>userList</code> and <code>address</code> parameters. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk.</p>

---

### Details

Vulnerable Endpoint: `mailing_lists.shtm`

Parameters: `name`,`userList` and `address`

<p align="justify">The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the <code>name</code>, <code>userList</code> and <code>address</code> parameters. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system.</p>
